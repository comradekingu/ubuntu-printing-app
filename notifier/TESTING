This subtree contains the daemon for notifying of successful print jobs,
and of issues with the printer when jobs are printed, under Unity 8.
This document describes how to test some notifications.


Testing

0) Make sure the notifier daemon is running:

  $: ./build/notifier/src/printing-notifier-service

1) Add a null printer, if one is not already configured, and enable it:

  $: lpadmin -p nulldevice -E -v file:///dev/null
  $: cupsenable nulldevice

2) Print a test page:

  $: lpr -P nulldevice -J "Test Page" /usr/share/cups/data/default-testpage.pdf

  The document should "print" immediately, and you should get a notification
  that reads '"Test Page" has printed."

3) Pause the printer, print another test page, and emit the PrinterStateChanged
   signal over dbus:

  $: cupsdisable nulldevice
  $: lpr -P nulldevice -J "Test Page" /usr/share/cups/data/default-testpage.pdf
  $: gdbus emit -y -o /org/cups/cupsd/Notifier \
     -s org.cups.cupsd.Notifier.PrinterStateChanged \
     "Some text" "cups://nulldevice" "nulldevice" 'uint32 0' "toner-low" true

  You should see a notification for the toner being low, with one job
  queued on the printer. Clicking the OK button should close the notification
  and perform no further actions. Clicking the "Settingsâ€¦" button should
  cause system-settings to open to the settings page for that particular
  printer.
